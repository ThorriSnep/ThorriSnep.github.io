In this post I want to go through how to get the kernel source-tree and how to bulid a kernel from it.
For every one how dosen't know yet: the kernel source-tree is a directory witch contains all the source code needed to bulid a kernel.
Before we start I recomend you create a directory for your self to work in. e.g. `mkdir ~/kernelbld`

# Getting the kernel source-tree

I recomend to just get your kernel source-tree form [the Linux kernel archives](https://www.kernel.org/) unless you have a need for a specific build.

After downloading the source-tree you should have a compressed archive. Now go into the directory you created to work in and extract it with `tar -xf ~/Downloads/linux-{{ version }}.tar.xz`

# What is in the source code?

Let's get an overview of the source tree:
```
arch   COPYING  Documentation  include  Kbuild   lib          Makefile  README   security  usr
block  CREDITS  drivers        init     Kconfig  LICENSES     mm        samples  sound     virt
certs  crypto   fs             ipc      kernel   MAINTAINERS  net       scripts  tools
```
To make it easeyer to get an overview lets split these files into 3 categories:

## Documentation

### README
This file should be your first point of contact. Here it is documented how to find and bulid the documentation for the kernel.

### MAINTAINERS
This file lists all maintainers of the different modules found in the kernel. If you want to submit a patch this file also provide a guide on how to do so.

### COPYING
This file provides the licenses under witch the kernel is relesed.

## Main Subsystems

### Makefile
This is the top level make file that is used by the kernel build system (we will discuss that in more detail later) and the kernel modules.
