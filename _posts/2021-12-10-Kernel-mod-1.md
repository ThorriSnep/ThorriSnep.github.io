Here I want to tell you about the motivation for developing kernel modules and what the hell even the kernel is.

#1. What is a kernel?

Before even starting to wirte a kernel module it is probably importand to know what a kernel even is.
In short a the kernel is the part of the operating system that maneges the hardware and fasilitates the communication of the software that runs on the system with that hardware.
For us the most importand job of the kernel will probably be memory manegment witch entails the segeregation of virtuall memory into user space and kernel space why this is done we might go into at a later point.
An other importand job of the kernel is the interaction with devices through devices drivers.


We can in general differantiate between 3 differantiate kernel structures:
##1. Monolythic kernel:
Here all fetures of the OS like the filesystem, schedular, device drivers, memory managment, basic and application interprocess communication... run in kernel mode.

##2. Micro kernel:
Here the fetures of the OS are split into a minimal kernel witch only posesses basic funktionality like the schedular, memory managment and basic IPC leaving a minimal amount the funktionality running in kernel mode.
The rest of the funktionality of the OS is handeld by "servers" like a filesystem server or device drivers running in user mode.

##3. Hybrid kernel:
A hybrid kernel trys to combine the benfits of the monolythic and micro kernel.
